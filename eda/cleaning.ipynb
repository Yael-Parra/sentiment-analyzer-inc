         "Thus, with a collapse of the USA, only two possibilities can be considered, whereby, with the one, it boils down to a dictatorship with evil reprisals, while the other possibility may be a new reconstruction, if people who are fundamentally conscious of their responsibilities attain government and really do everything to bring about an effective and valuable new start. But whether this will actually occur, is currently extremely questionable, because presently, in a totalitarian manner, everything is directed towards interests which are economic, military, political and cultural – as well as towards that which is strict fundamentalist religious-sectarian – and based on enormous lies and devious, misanthropic, criminal and felonious machinations in every imaginable regard. This also means that the population of the USA is spied upon by the secret services and even severely within the neighbourhoods, and so forth, and, in every possible manner being restricted in its freedom, and this is in addition to the violence, as it emerges in some form or other, both openly and covertly.﻿",

The shooting in Utah unwarranted because he ran, don't know why he ran but if you lunged at the police with the fake sword you should have taken that opportunity for immediate action right then. He ran and was shot 6 times in the back. We know a large group of cops are corrupt and these murderers are nothing new. Though I have ran from the police many times when I was in my teens, cops just pursue and find him hiding some where. Not just put 6 bullets in the back ending a life.
